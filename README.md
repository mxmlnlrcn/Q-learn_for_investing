# Q-learn_for_investing
Q-learn algorithm to make investment decisions 

This project was built to make investment decisions based on a state provided by ambiente.py. This environment takes the data of the asset that you want to invest in, and it applies some technical indicators and trading strategies to make an array with the information of the entry points given by those strategies.

This algorithm's profitability depends on when you start the algorithm because in the testing period, it makes huge profits in some starting points and huge losses in other points, for that reason I do not recommend the use of this bot with a real account but it is still interesting to analyze the behaviour of this approach for more complex models.

To run the project, you should run e.py and have Python installed along with ta-lib library
