# Q-learn_for_investing
Q-learn algorithm to make investments decisions 

This project was built to make investments decisions based in a state provided by ambiente.py. This environment takes the data of the asset that you want to invest, and it applies some technical indicators and trading strategies to make an array with the information of the entry points given by those strategies.

This algorithm profitability depends on when you start the algorithm, because in the testing period it makes huge profits in some starting points and huge losses in other points, for that reason I do not recommend the use of this bot but maybe with some changes it will have reliable profits.
